# Implementing_IOT_Pipeline

### **Review of Sprint 1**


#### 1. **Form the Project Team**
Backend: Samir
System administer: Abdulsalam
Front end/Design: Krishna
Front end/Tester: Rabin
Project manager: Mukhtar


---

#### 2. **Set Up the Project Repository and Send Collaboration Invitations**

- Branch: Frontend, Backend, IoT 
- `.gitignore` file to avoid committing unnecessary files (e.g., `node_modules`, `.env`).
- Enabling CI/CD pipelines (e.g., automatic linting, testing, or deployment on Git pushes).
- **Deliverable**: Repository link with collaborators added, README.md file for the project overview.

---

#### 3. **Project Scope and Goals**

- "Develop a reservation system integrated with IoT-enabled door systems."
- "Enable secure real-time door access for confirmed bookings."
- Goals for user experience (e.g., booking confirmation under 2 seconds).

---

- The IoT component involves smart locks or door sensors that interface with the backend reservation system via access control APIs. This enables the backend to recognize reservation changes in real time and provide or restrict access based on the guest's check-in status. Guests interact with the system through the site, and the backend ensures their access rights are updated dynamically.
- **Deliverable**: A project charter or a documented report.

---

#### 4. **Milestones and Deadlines**

1. System design completed.
2. Website reservation system prototype.
3. IoT door system integrated.
4. Testing and debugging phase.
- Gantt chart or roadmap tool for visual tracking.(Optional)
- **Deliverable**: A timeline (using monday.com).

---

#### 5. **Tools and Platforms for Communication**

-  (Slack/Discord) and/or (Teams/Zoom).
- Communication norms: weekly updates in a choosen channel or bi-weekly video calls. (Discord)
- **Deliverable**: Documented communication plan (e.g., where and how to report progress/issues). (sent to discord announcement section)

---

#### 6. **Ensure Development Tools are Installed and Configured**


- Create a checklist of tools (e.g., Node.js, VSCode, Docker, testing frameworks) and their versions.
- Set up a shared `.env.example` file to ensure consistent configuration.
- **Deliverable**: A completed checklist with everyone confirming they’re set up.


---

#### 7. **Define Testing Plan**

- **Recommendation**:
    - Specify the types of testing you’ll conduct (e.g., unit testing for APIs, end-to-end testing for the reservation flow, stress testing for IoT devices).
    - Assign a person to lead the testing phase.
- **Deliverable**: A testing plan document outlining scope, tools (e.g., Jest, Postman), and testing schedules.
